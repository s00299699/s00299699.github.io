											<h3>Where it all began...</h3>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Me.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>So let's start with where it all began back in 2008 in kindergarten. I was quite a shy kid at first but did enjoy going to school especially since some of my friends from pre-school were also in my class. I remember quite vividly my teacher Miss Maude and how she would always try to make her class fun and exciting to keep us as interested as she possibly could being 4 and 5 year olds. Overall, primary school was a pretty enjoyable experience which allowed me to explore who I was as a person and come out of my shell and increase my confidence. But in particular throughout highschool saw a different experience for me, one that I hadn't had before which required a lot more organisational skills to remain up to date which took me a little while to pick up. Through the many years and the many teachers there was one teacher in particular that has really influenced me today and is the reason I want to be a teacher.</p>

											<h3>Why I want to be a Technology Teacher</h3>
											<p>Technology as a subject has really shaped me as a person and is the prime reason where I am today. My Year 7 teacher Mr Smith in 2015 first exposed me to this subject where Industrial Timber, Industrial metal and Information and software technologies were explored. Year 8 in 2016 was where my love for the subject first began. My teacher Mrs White became my role model showing us Food technology, Textiles and Timber once again. Year 9+10 I decided to choose food Technology as an elective and this was where I discovered my strength and ability in the kitchen. My teacher Mrs DiPietro was there to assist and lead my learning and development in this subject and consistently be there whenever I needed extra help.

											However it wasn't until year 11 and 12 in 2019-2020 in the subject Hospitality where I began to truely find joy in this subject. This was mostly due to Mrs White who I had again (appears left). She pushed me to succeed knowing full well my strengths and weeknesses. Entering me into cooking competitions where I placed 3rd in the first round and 3rd again in the second round. Mrs White is my inspiration and is the reason I want to be a teacher today. She showed me what its truely like to experience an amazing teacher and how this relationship can see success in a student. I aspire to be like her and I hope that one day I am able to go back to my high school and teach alongside her.</p>
