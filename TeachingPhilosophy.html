												<h2>Teachers offer the gift of learning...</h2>
												<p>I believe the purpose of education is to ensure all students learn and grow to the best of their ability. I believe students learn best when they are shown exactly how to do something and are given a path to follow. Also, students learn through their learning style and as an educator its my job to teach them using all three learning styles.</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Classroom.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>Overall my schooling experience so far has taught me that when studying a subject I enjoy , I achieve more than the subjects that I have to put in extra effort for. This has ultimately shown me my passions and has steered me in the direction to become a teacher to influence the next generation of kids to have the same experience as i did throughout highschool as it can be a scary and stressful time in an adolescent life. This has helped validate my opinions on what education truly is and how it has to be different for each student to get the most out of it.</p>

											<h3>My Philosophy</h3>
											<p>I believe that we educate to allow students to further develop their own individual assumptions and to provide them with the necessary knowledge and skills that are required to live a successful life. Nel Noddings states that “the aims of education are derived from the basic premise that the child is born good and will develop best if education by people and education by things are well coordinated with the education provided by nature”. This ultimately teaches problem solving and clearly shows personal growth within the individual. The United Nations Rights of the child states that “Education should develop each child’s personality and talents to the full. It should encourage children to respect their parents, their cultures and other cultures.” Which further explores the fact that education should be personalised to each child to fully bring out their talents and likes to enhance the necessary skills within the child.</p>

											<p>The curriculum is the set standard that describes how and what each teacher should teach their class, however, it needs to be changed to keep up with the modern world and the rapid changes within society. The curriculum shouldnt be set as we discover that each child has their own learning context and own ways to learn which should have an individualistic approach to learning to set that child up for success. Without the appropriate customisation that child can feel lost and confused which may result in a lack of effort towards learning. The Australian professional teaching standards state that teachers must “Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of research into how students learn and the implications for teaching.” meaning that education has to be altered to suit the child and their needs.</p>

											<p>Education matters for society as it teaches the necessary basic skills that are required in life. However this should only be setting up the student for success with the basic knowledge as then the child is free to explore their own interests and learn how they want to learn. A teacher should be more of a “creator of learning environments, more of a friend to the child, a more subtle educator and someone able to engage and focus the natural curiosity of the child”</p>

											<p>To be an ethical teacher means to know the difference between right and wrong and thinking about what is best for the child. This may be just simply pushing them and challenging them to achieve and to test their knowledge within reason. To be an ethical teacher means to give every student the same attention and the same chance as every other student to set them on their paths to success. “Good teachers have well reasoned opinions about important issues which forms a further part of their personal philosophy”</p>

											<p>For my future professional self I see me as a teacher who supports the needs of the students and pushes them along this path for their personal best. Being this teacher will hopefully allow me to build strong relationships with my students and increase the trust between the students and myself to guide them on their highschool journey.</p>
